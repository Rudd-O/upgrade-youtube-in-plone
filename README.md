Upgrade YouTube embeds in a Plone site
======================================

The script `upgrade-youtube-embeds` will help you upgrade old YouTube `embed`
tags to `iframe` tags, as well as upgrading those embedded videos to use
HTTPS (SSL / TLS).

Use this after you have migrated you site to SSL and you discovered that
the videos you've embedded do not work anymore, as well as getting rid of
Flash-based YouTube embedded videos by upgrading them to the more modern
way of embedding them.

To use it, copy it to your Plone instance's computer, then follow the
instructions on the header of the script.
